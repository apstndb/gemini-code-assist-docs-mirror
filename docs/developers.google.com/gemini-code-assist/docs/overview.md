Gemini Code Assist offers AI-powered assistance to help your development team build, deploy, and operate applications throughout the software development lifecycle. Gemini Code Assist is available in the following editions:

  - [Gemini Code Assist Standard](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/overview#supported-features) , a product in the [Gemini for Google Cloud](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/overview) portfolio.

  - [Gemini Code Assist Enterprise](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/overview#supported-features) , a product in the [Gemini for Google Cloud](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/overview) portfolio.

You can use Gemini Code Assist in [supported IDEs](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/supported-languages#supported_ides) , such as VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, or Android Studio, for AI-powered coding assistance in [many popular languages](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/supported-languages) . You can get code completions as you write your code, generate full functions or code blocks from comments, generate unit tests, and get help with debugging, understanding, and documenting your code.

Gemini Code Assist provides contextualized responses to your prompts, including [source citations](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/works#how-when-gemini-cites-sources) regarding which documentation and code samples Gemini Code Assist used to generate its responses.

The Gemini large language models (LLMs) that are used by Gemini Code Assist are trained on datasets of publicly available code, Google Cloud-specific material, and other relevant technical information in addition to the datasets used to train the Gemini [foundation models](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_1_report.pdf) . Models are trained so that Gemini Code Assist responses are as useful to Gemini Code Assist users as possible.

As an early-stage technology, Gemini Code Assist can generate output that seems plausible but is factually incorrect. We recommend that you validate all output from Gemini Code Assist before you use it. For more information, see [Gemini Code Assist and responsible AI](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/responsible-ai) .

Gemini Code Assist provides citation information when it directly quotes at length from another source, such as existing open source code. For more information, see [How and when Gemini cites sources](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/works#how-when-gemini-cites-sources) .
