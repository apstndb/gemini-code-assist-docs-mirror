> **Note:** We have unified our tools into a single, multi-agent platform called Antigravity, with Antigravity CLI now available. Starting June 18, 2026, Gemini Code Assist IDE Extensions and Gemini CLI stopped serving requests for the Gemini Code Assist for individuals, Google AI Pro, and Google AI Ultra tiers. Affected users should migrate to Antigravity and Antigravity CLI. To learn more, see the [deprecation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/deprecations/code-assist-individuals) .

This page describes how to set up Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise.

Before you can use services available to users with [Gemini Code Assist](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/overview) Standard or Enterprise licenses, your team needs to perform the setup steps that are described in this document:

> **Note:** An administrator typically performs steps 1-4.

1.  [Purchase a subscription to Gemini Code Assist Standard or Enterprise](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/set-up-gemini#purchase-subscription) .

2.  [Assign licenses to users in your organization](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/set-up-gemini#assign_licenses) .

3.  [Enable the Gemini for Google Cloud API in a Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/set-up-gemini#enable-api) .

4.  [Grant Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles in a Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/set-up-gemini#grant-iam) .

5.  Your organization's users set up the services they want to use.
    
    1.  To use Gemini Code Assist Standard or Enterprise in an IDE, users should [install the Gemini Code Assist plugin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/set-up-gemini#install-gemini-code-assist) , which is documented on this page.
    
    2.  To use Gemini Code Assist code customization, users should refer to [Configure Gemini Code Assist code customization](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/code-customization) .
    
    3.  To use Gemini CLI, users should follow the [Gemini CLI installation instructions](https://geminicli.com/docs/get-started/installation/) , and then they should authenticate by [setting a Google Cloud project](https://geminicli.com/docs/get-started/authentication#set-your-google-cloud-project) .
    
    4.  To use Gemini in Android Studio, users should refer to [Get started with Gemini in Android Studio for businesses](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/get-started-businesses) .

## Purchase a Gemini Code Assist subscription

To purchase a new Gemini Code Assist subscription, [contact Google Cloud sales](https://cloud.google.com/contact) . For a list of features available in each Gemini Code Assist edition, see [Supported features](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/overview#supported-features) .

If you have an existing Gemini Code Assist subscription, you can [manage and renew it through the Google Cloud console](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/admin) .

## Assign licenses

Once a subscription is purchased for Gemini Code Assist Standard or Enterprise, you manage Gemini Code Assist license assignments in your organization using the Google Cloud console.

Before using a Gemini Code Assist license, users must have the Gemini for Google Cloud User role or analogous permissions on a project where the API is already enabled.

By default, new subscriptions are set up for automatic license assignment. A user in your organization is automatically assigned a license when they use Gemini Code Assist within a supported IDE, provided all the following conditions are met:

  - The user has selected a project that is associated with the subscription's billing account.
  - The user has the `cloudaicompanion.licenses.selfAssign` IAM permission on the selected project.

If a license is inactive for 30 days, then it will be automatically assigned to another user in your organization who meets the preceding conditions.

When all available licenses in the subscription are assigned, users who try to access Gemini Code Assist without a license will receive an error message indicating one is required.

After you set up Gemini Code Assist, you can view license assignments by navigating to the **Admin for Gemini** page, selecting your billing account, clicking **Manage Gemini Code Assist Subscription** , and then selecting the **License management** tab. If you require finer control over license assignments, you can also use this tab to switch from automatic license management to [manual license management](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/manage-licenses#manual) .

The [Gemini for Google Cloud API](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/set-up-gemini#enable-api) must be enabled in one or more projects that are associated with this billing account. Users won't see Gemini Code Assist until you activate it in at least one project.

## Enable the Gemini for Google Cloud API in a Google Cloud project

This section describes the steps required to enable the Gemini for Google Cloud API in a Google Cloud project. Gemini Code Assist requires a Google Cloud project to manage API access, quota, and billing. For this reason, you need to enable the Gemini for Google Cloud API in a Google Cloud project of your choice before users can access Gemini Code Assist.

### Console

1.  To enable the Gemini for Google Cloud API, go to the **Gemini for Google Cloud** page.

2.  In the project selector, select a project.

3.  Click **Enable** .
    
    The page updates and shows a status of **Enabled** . Gemini is now available in the selected Google Cloud project to all users who have the required IAM roles.

### gcloud CLI

1.  In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.

2.  In the project selector menu, select a project.

3.  Enable the Gemini for Google Cloud API for Gemini using the [`gcloud services enable` command](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/enable) :
    
        gcloud services enable cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com
    
    If you want to enable the Gemini for Google Cloud API in a different Google Cloud project, add the `--project` parameter:
    
        gcloud services enable cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com --project PROJECT_ID
    
    Replace `  PROJECT_ID  ` with your Google Cloud project ID.
    
    The output is similar to the following:
    
    ```console
    Waiting for async operation operations/acf.2e2fcfce-8327-4984-9040-a67777082687 to complete...
    Operation finished successfully.
    ```

Gemini features are now available in the specified Google Cloud project to all users who have the [required IAM roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/set-up-gemini#grant-iam) .

### Configure the firewall for API traffic between your IDE and Google

In addition to enabling the Gemini for Google Cloud API, users behind firewalls also need to allow traffic to pass through for the following APIs:

  - [`oauth2.googleapis.com`](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) : used to sign in to Google Cloud.
  - [`serviceusage.googleapis.com`](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/serviceusage.googleapis.com) : used for checking that the user's Gemini Code Assist project is properly configured.
  - [`cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com`](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com) : the primary Gemini Code Assist API endpoint.
  - `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` : an internal API that provides IDE-related features.
  - [`cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com`](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com) : used in the IDEs for project pickers. The Resource Manager API may not be necessary if the projects are explicitly configured in your `settings.json` file.
  - [`people.googleapis.com`](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/people.googleapis.com) : provides access to information about profiles and contacts.
  - `firebaselogging-pa.googleapis.com` : an internal API used for sending product telemetry including events as to whether suggestions were accepted.
  - `feedback-pa.googleapis.com` : an internal API used for in-IDE feedback submission.
  - [`apihub.googleapis.com`](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/apihub.googleapis.com) : used by the Cloud Code API Browser feature.
  - `lh3.googleusercontent.com` and `lh5.googleusercontent.com` : used to obtain user photos.

### Determine IP addresses for Google Cloud default domains

To enable connectivity from your IDE to Google Cloud APIs, your firewall must allow outbound TCP traffic to Google's publicly documented IP address ranges. These ranges are dynamically managed by Google.

To maintain a list of IP ranges to access Google Cloud domains, you have several options:

  - Use our published lists or automate a script to [obtain Google IP address ranges](https://support.google.com/a/answer/10026322) .
  - Use the [private.googleapis.com Virtual IP](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access#domain-options) .
  - Use [Private Service Connect](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-apis) .

### Optional: Configure VPC Service Controls

If your organization has a service perimeter, then you must add the following resources to your perimeter:

  - Gemini for Google Cloud API
  - Gemini Code Assist API

If you are using Gemini Code Assist Standard or Enterprise from outside of your service perimeter, then you also need to modify the ingress policy to allow access to those services.

For more information, see [Configure VPC Service Controls for Gemini](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/configure-vpc-service-controls) .

## Grant IAM roles in a Google Cloud project

This section describes the steps required to grant the Gemini for Google Cloud User and Service Usage Consumer IAM roles to users.

### Console

1.  To grant the IAM roles that are required to use Gemini, go to the **IAM & Admin** page.

2.  Click **Grant access** , and then enter the [principal](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#concepts_related_identity) name for which you want to give access to Gemini.

3.  In the **Grant access** pane, click add **Add another role** .

4.  In **Assign roles** , select **Gemini for Google Cloud User** .

5.  Click **Add roles** and select **Service Usage Consumer** .

6.  Click **Save** .

### gcloud CLI

1.  In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.

2.  In the project selector menu, select a project.

3.  Grant the Gemini for Google Cloud User role:
    
        gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
          --member=PRINCIPAL --role=roles/cloudaicompanion.user
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the ID of your Google Cloud project—for example, `my-project-id` .
      - `  PRINCIPAL  ` : the [identifier](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-identifiers) for the principal. For user accounts, this identifier is in the format `user:EMAIL_ADDRESS` —for example, `user:cloudysanfrancisco@gmail.com` .
    
    The output is a list of policy bindings that includes the following:
    
        - members:
          - user:PRINCIPAL
          role: roles/cloudaicompanion.user

4.  Repeat the previous step for the role `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` .

For more information, see [Grant a single role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role) and [`gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/projects/add-iam-policy-binding) .

All of the users who have been granted these roles can access Gemini features in the Google Cloud console within the specified project. For more information, see [Google Cloud with Gemini overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/overview) .

## Install the Gemini Code Assist plugin

## Advanced setup tasks

The following sections describe advanced setup tasks that you can perform to customize Gemini Code Assist.

### Advanced IAM considerations

Instead of using the Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI to grant predefined IAM roles, you can do any of the following:

  - Use [IAM REST APIs](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest) or [IAM client libraries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/libraries) to grant roles.
    
    If you use these interfaces, use the fully qualified role names:
    
      - `roles/cloudaicompanion.user`
      - `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer`
    
    For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

  - Create and grant custom roles.
    
    Any [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) that you create need the following permissions for you to access Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise:
    
      - `cloudaicompanion.instances.completeCode`
      - `cloudaicompanion.instances.completeTask`
      - `cloudaicompanion.instances.generateCode`
      - `cloudaicompanion.instances.generateText`
      - `cloudaicompanion.instances.exportMetrics`
      - `cloudaicompanion.instances.queryEffectiveSetting`
      - `cloudaicompanion.instances.queryEffectiveSettingBindings`
      - `serviceusage.services.enable`

  - Assign and manage licenses.
    
    Any [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) that you create need the following permissions for you to assign and manage Gemini Code Assist licenses:
    
      - `consumerprocurement.orders.get`
      - `consumerprocurement.orders.licensePools.*`
      - `consumerprocurement.orders.licensePools.update`
      - `consumerprocurement.orders.licensePools.get`
      - `consumerprocurement.orders.licensePools.assign`
      - `consumerprocurement.orders.licensePools.unassign`
      - `consumerprocurement.orders.licensePools.enumerateLicensedUsers`

Also note that for any of the preceding permissions to work, the Gemini for Google Cloud API needs to be enabled in the same Google Cloud project where you've assigned each permission.

### Change the Google Cloud project release channel

We release Gemini Code Assist features in different release channels, either Generally Available or Preview. When you set up Gemini Code Assist, your project is automatically set to the Generally Available release channel.

You can [change the Gemini Code Assist release channel](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/configure-release-channels) to the Preview channel or back to the Generally Available channel at any time.
