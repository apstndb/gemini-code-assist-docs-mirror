---

This document describes how to generate Gemini Code Assist metrics. For example, you can generate metrics that report the daily active usage or the acceptance of code recommendations for a variety of Google Cloud products, including Cloud Logging, Google Cloud CLI, Cloud Monitoring, and BigQuery.

If you need to enable and view Gemini Code Assist prompt, response, and metadata logs, see [View Gemini Code Assist logs](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/log-gemini) .

## Limitations

This page applies specifically to generating metrics for user interactions with Gemini Code Assist within an IDE.

  - For information about logging metrics for [Gemini CLI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli) , which requires you to set up Open Telemetry, see [Gemini CLI telemetry](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/telemetry/) .

  - [Gemini Code Assist on GitHub](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-repo-code) doesn't support logging in Google Cloud.

## Before you begin

  - Ensure you have [set up Gemini Code Assist](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/set-up-gemini) in your project.

  - Ensure you have [enabled Gemini Code Assist logging](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/log-gemini#enable) in your project.

  - In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
    
    At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works) session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment with the Google Cloud CLI already installed and with values already set for your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.

## List the number of unique users

The following instructions describe how to use the gcloud CLI to list the number of unique users of Gemini Code Assist in the most recent 28-day period:

1.  In a shell environment, ensure that you have updated all installed components of the [gcloud CLI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) to the latest version:
    
        gcloud components update

2.  Read the log entries for Gemini Code Assist users and usage:
    
        gcloud logging read 'resource.type=cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/Instance labels.product=~"code_assist"' \
        --freshness 28d \
        --project PROJECT_ID \
        --format "csv(timestamp.date('%Y-%m-%d'),labels.user_id)"
    
    Replace `  PROJECT_ID  ` with your Google Cloud project ID.
    
    You can use the Unix command `uniq` to uniquely identify users on a per-day basis.
    
    The output is similar to the following:
    
        2024-10-30,user1@company.com
        2024-10-29,user2@company.com
        2024-10-29,user2@company.com
        2024-10-29,user2@company.com
        2024-10-29,user1@company.com
        2024-10-28,user1@company.com

## Create a chart that displays daily usage

The following steps show how to use Monitoring to create daily use graphs that show the aggregate total of daily active Gemini Code Assist users and the number of their requests per day.

1.  Create a Monitoring metric from your log data that records the number of Gemini Code Assist users:
    
    1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the segment **Logs Explorer** page:
        
        If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is **Logging** .
    
    2.  In the query pane, enter the following query, and then click **Run query** :
        
        ``` 
         resource.type="cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/Instance" AND labels.product="code_assist" AND jsonPayload.@type="type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.cloudaicompanion.logging.v1.ResponseLog"
        ```
        
        > **Note:** The default time period value is **Last 1 hour** , but you can set it to a longer time period (such as **Last 7 days** ).
    
    3.  In the toolbar, click **Actions** , and then select **Create metric** .
        
        The **Create log-based metric** dialog appears.
    
    4.  Configure the following metric details:
        
          - Ensure the **Metric Type** is set to **Counter** .
        
          - Name the metric `code_assist_example` .
        
          - Ensure **Filter selection** is set to point to the location where your logs are being stored, either **Project** or **Bucket** .
            
            For information about generating Monitoring metrics from your log data, see [Log-based metrics overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/logging/docs/logs-based-metrics) .
    
    5.  Click **Create metric** .
        
        A success banner is displayed, explaining the metric was created.
    
    6.  In that success banner, click **View in Metrics explorer** .
        
        Metrics Explorer opens and displays a preconfigured chart.
        
        > **Note:** It may take up to 10 minutes for data to populate on the chart. For more information, see [Metric is missing logs data](https://docs.cloud.google.com/logging/docs/logs-based-metrics/troubleshooting#slow-startup) .

2.  Save the chart to a dashboard:
    
    1.  In the toolbar, click **Save chart** .
    2.  Optional: Update the chart title.
    3.  Use the **Dashboard** menu either to select an existing custom dashboard or to create a new dashboard.
    4.  Click **Save chart** .

## Analyze usage by using BigQuery

The following steps show how to use BigQuery to analyze your log data.

There are two approaches that you can use to analyze your log data in BigQuery:

  - [Create a log sink](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/generate-metrics#create-sink) and export your log data to a BigQuery dataset.
  - Upgrade the log bucket that stores your log data to use [Observability Analytics](https://docs.cloud.google.com/logging/docs/log-analytics#analytics) , and then create a linked BigQuery dataset.

With both approaches, you can use SQL to query and analyze your log data, and you can chart the results of those queries. If you use Observability Analytics, then you can save your charts to a custom dashboard. However, there are differences in pricing. For details, see [Observability Analytics pricing](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing#logging-costs) and [BigQuery pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) .

This section describes how to create a log sink to export select log entries to BigQuery, and it provides a list of sample queries. If you want to know more about Observability Analytics, see [Query and analyze logs with Observability Analytics](https://docs.cloud.google.com/logging/docs/analyze/query-and-view) and [Query a linked BigQuery dataset](https://docs.cloud.google.com/logging/docs/analyze/query-linked-dataset) .

### Create a log sink

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Log Router** page:
    
    If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is **Logging** .

2.  Select the Google Cloud project in which the log entries that you want to route originate.

3.  Select **Create sink** .

4.  In the **Sink details** panel, enter the following details:
    
      - For **Sink name** , provide an identifier for the sink. After you create the sink, you can't rename the sink but you can delete it and create a new sink.
    
      - For **Sink description** , describe the purpose or use case for the sink.

5.  In the **Sink destination** panel, configure the following details:
    
      - For **Select sink service** , select **BigQuery dataset** .
      - For **Select BigQuery dataset** , create a new BigQuery dataset and name it `code_assist_bq` .

6.  Open the **Choose logs to include in sink** panel, and in the **Build inclusion filter** field, enter the following:
    
        resource.type="cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/Instance" AND labels.product="code_assist"

7.  Optional: To verify that you entered the correct filter, select **Preview logs** . The Logs Explorer opens in a new tab with the filter pre-populated.

8.  Click **Create sink** .

### Authorize the log sink to write log entries to the dataset

When you have Owner access to the BigQuery dataset, Cloud Logging grants the log sink the necessary permissions to write log data.

If you don't have Owner access or if you don't see any entries in your dataset, then the log sink might not have the required permissions. To resolve this failure, follow the instructions in [Set destination permissions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2#dest-auth) .

### Queries

You can use the following sample BigQuery queries to generate user- and aggregate-level data for daily active use and suggestions generated.

Before using the following sample queries, you must obtain the fully qualified path for the [newly created sink](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/generate-metrics#create-sink) . To obtain the path, do the following:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the resources list, locate the dataset named `code_assist_bq` . This data is the [sink destination](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/generate-metrics#sink_destination) .

3.  Select the responses table from beneath the `code_assist_bq_dataset` , click the more\_vert icon, and then click **Copy ID** to generate the dataset ID. Make note of it so that you can use it in the following sections as the GENERATED\_BIGQUERY\_TABLE variable.

#### List individual users by day

    SELECT DISTINCT labels.user_id as user, DATE(timestamp) as use_date
    FROM GENERATED_BIGQUERY_TABLE
    ORDER BY use_date

Replace GENERATED\_BIGQUERY\_TABLE with the fully qualified path of the BigQuery response table you noted in the [previous steps for creating a sink](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/generate-metrics#create-sink) .

#### List aggregate users by day

    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT labels.user_id) as total_users, DATE(timestamp) as use_date
    FROM GENERATED_BIGQUERY_TABLE
    GROUP BY use_date
    ORDER BY use_date

#### List individual requests per day by user

    SELECT COUNT(*), DATE(timestamp) as use_date, labels.user_id as user
    FROM GENERATED_BIGQUERY_TABLE
    GROUP BY use_date, user
    ORDER BY use_date

#### List aggregate requests per day by date

    SELECT COUNT(*), DATE(timestamp) as use_date
    FROM GENERATED_BIGQUERY_TABLE
    GROUP BY use_date
    ORDER BY use_date
